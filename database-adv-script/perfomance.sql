-- üß™ Performance Analysis Tip:
-- Run: EXPLAIN ANALYZE <above query> to inspect scan types and costs

-- ‚úÖ Refactored Query: Only fetch essential columns and use indexing
-- (Assumes indexes on user_id, property_id, and booking_id are already created)
SELECT 
    b.booking_id,
    b.start_date,
    b.end_date,
    b.status,
    CONCAT(u.first_name, ' ', u.last_name) AS user_fullname,
    u.email,
    p.name AS property_name,
    pay.amount
FROM 
    bookings b
JOIN users u ON b.user_id = u.user_id
JOIN properties p ON b.property_id = p.property_id
LEFT JOIN payments pay ON b.booking_id = pay.booking_id
ORDER BY b.start_date DESC;

-- üîé Notes:
-- - Removes unnecessary fields to minimize data load
-- - Applies ORDER BY for efficient pagination (with indexing on start_date)
-- - Preserves LEFT JOIN for optional payments
